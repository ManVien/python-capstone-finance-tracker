## üß† Python Concepts Practiced

- Variables and data types (strings, floats, dictionaries, tuples)
- Lists and dictionaries
- Functions (`def`) for reusable code
- Loops (`while`, `for`)
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- User input (`input()`) within a notebook
- Exception handling with `try-except`
- String formatting for clean output

## üöÄ Suggested Improvements

If you want to extend this project, try:

- Saving expenses to a CSV or JSON file for long-term tracking
- Loading saved data when the notebook starts
- Adding visualizations (bar charts for spending per category)
- Integrating date and time for each expense record
